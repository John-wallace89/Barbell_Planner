<h1 style="text-align: center">The Barbell Planner</h1>

![hero image screenshot]()

This is my submission for Milestone project 3. The Barbell Planner is a fitness based application allowing the user
to log a specific kind of workout. The user will be able to authenticate themself, log a workout, and then Edit or Delete
that workout from the list they have created. The application will also allow them to navigate to the Barbell gym site
and Social Media channels.

aesthetic of the site.

aesthetic and a setting in space. Images were used to display the characters mentioned throughout the site.

### Further testing ###

     The navigation links do not render correctly on Iphone 5 screen:
     ![hero image screenshot](assets/images/screenshots/user_story_12.JPG)
     Resolved: No, Iphone 5 is now an old model and the navigation renders correctly on all Iphone models in
     the last 5 years. 
     Future fix may include a collapsable nav bar that lends itself to smaller screens.
